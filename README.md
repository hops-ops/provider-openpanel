# Provider Upjet OpenPanel

`provider-openpanel` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/crossplane/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
[OpenPanel](https://openpanel.com/) API.

## Getting Started

Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/hops-ops/provider-openpanel):

```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
